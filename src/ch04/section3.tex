\section{Groups Acting on Themselves by Conjugation}

Let $G$ be a group.

\Exercise1 Suppose $G$ has a left action on a set $A$, denoted by
$g\cdot a$ for all $g\in G$ and $a\in A$. Denote the corresponding
right action on $A$ by $a\cdot g$. Prove that the (equivalence)
relations $\sim$ and $\sim'$ defined by
\begin{equation*}
  a\sim b \quad\text{if and only if}\quad a = g\cdot b
  \quad\text{for some $g\in G$}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  a\sim'b \quad\text{if and only if}\quad a = b\cdot g
  \quad\text{for some $g\in G$}
\end{equation*}
are the same relation (i.e., $a\sim b$ if and only if $a\sim'b$).
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $a\sim b$ and let $g$ be such that $a = g\cdot b$. Take
  $h = g^{-1}$. Then, since the left and right actions correspond, we
  have
  \begin{equation*}
    a = g\cdot b = b\cdot g^{-1} = b\cdot h.
  \end{equation*}
  Hence $a\sim' b$. We can also see that the implication works in the
  other direction. Therefore $\sim$ and $\sim'$ are the same relation.
\end{proof}
