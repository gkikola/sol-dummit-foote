\section{Groups Acting on Themselves by Conjugation}

Let $G$ be a group.

\Exercise1 Suppose $G$ has a left action on a set $A$, denoted by
$g\cdot a$ for all $g\in G$ and $a\in A$. Denote the corresponding
right action on $A$ by $a\cdot g$. Prove that the (equivalence)
relations $\sim$ and $\sim'$ defined by
\begin{equation*}
  a\sim b \quad\text{if and only if}\quad a = g\cdot b
  \quad\text{for some $g\in G$}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  a\sim'b \quad\text{if and only if}\quad a = b\cdot g
  \quad\text{for some $g\in G$}
\end{equation*}
are the same relation (i.e., $a\sim b$ if and only if $a\sim'b$).
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $a\sim b$ and let $g$ be such that $a = g\cdot b$. Take
  $h = g^{-1}$. Then, since the left and right actions correspond, we
  have
  \begin{equation*}
    a = g\cdot b = b\cdot g^{-1} = b\cdot h.
  \end{equation*}
  Hence $a\sim' b$. We can also see that the implication works in the
  other direction. Therefore $\sim$ and $\sim'$ are the same relation.
\end{proof}

\Exercise2 Find all conjugacy classes and their sizes in the following
groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $D_8$
  \begin{solution}
    We already know $Z(D_8) = \{1, r^2\}$. As stated in the text, for
    any $x\in D_8$ that is not in the center, $\ord{C_{D_8}(x)} =
    4$. That is, the centralizer has index $2$ and there are two
    elements in each such conjugacy class.

    First, since $srs^{-1} = r^3$, we see that $\{r, r^3\}$ is one
    conjugacy class. Next, $r(sr^2)r^{-1} = s$, so $\{s, sr^2\}$ is
    another. Lastly, $s(sr)s^{-1} = sr^3$, so $\{sr, sr^3\}$ is the
    remaining class.

    The conjugacy classes of $D_8$ are thus
    \begin{equation*}
      \{1\}, \quad
      \{r^2\}, \quad
      \{r, r^3\}, \quad
      \{s, sr^2\}, \quad\text{and}\quad
      \{sr, sr^3\}.
    \end{equation*}
    We see that the class equation is $\ord{D_8} = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2$.
  \end{solution}

\item $Q_8$
  \begin{solution}
    The center of $Q_8$ is $Z(Q_8) = \{1, -1\}$. In the text it was
    shown that $\{i, -i\}$ is one conjugacy class. In a similar way we
    can determine that
    $\ord{Q_8: C_{Q_8}(j)} = \ord{Q_8: C_{Q_8}(k)} = 2$ so the
    remaining classes have two elements. Since $iji^{-1} = -j$, we see
    that $\{j, -j\}$ is another class. And $jkj^{-1} = -k$, so the
    remaining class is $\{k, -k\}$.

    The conjugacy classes of $Q_8$ are therefore
    \begin{equation*}
      \{1\}, \quad
      \{-1\}, \quad
      \{i, -i\}, \quad
      \{j, -j\}, \quad\text{and}\quad
      \{k, -k\}.
    \end{equation*}
    The class equation is $\ord{Q_8} = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2$.
  \end{solution}

\item $A_4$
  \begin{solution}
    $A_4$ has a trivial center. Consider the even permutations
    \begin{equation*}
      1, \quad
      (1\,2\,3), \quad\text{and}\quad
      (1\,2)(3\,4).
    \end{equation*}
    These account for all the cycle types in $A_4$.

    The $3$-cycle $(1\,2\,3)$ commutes only with powers of itself and
    the identity. So $\ord{C_{A_4}((1\,2\,3))} = 3$ and
    $\ord{A_4 : C_{A_4}((1\,2\,3))} = 4$. Therefore there are four
    distinct conjugates of $(1\,2\,3)$. Since there are a total of
    eight $3$-cycles in $A_4$, they must be divided into two conjugacy
    classes. We compute,
    \begin{gather*}
      ((1\,2)(3\,4))(1\,2\,3)((1\,2)(3\,4))^{-1}
      = (1\,4\,2), \\
      ((1\,3)(2\,4))(1\,2\,3)((1\,3)(2\,4))^{-1}
      = (1\,3\,4), \\ \intertext{and}
      ((1\,4)(2\,3))(1\,2\,3)((1\,4)(2\,3))^{-1}
      = (2\,4\,3).
    \end{gather*}
    The remaining $3$-cycles would form the other class.

    Lastly, $(1\,2)(3\,4)$ commutes with $(1\,3)(2\,4)$ and
    $(1\,4)(2\,3)$, so its centralizer has four members and
    \begin{equation*}
      \ord{A_4 : C_{A_4}((1\,2)(3\,4))} = 3.
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore the three elements of order $2$ belong to a single
    conjugacy class.

    In summary, the conjugacy classes of $A_4$ are
    \begin{multline*}
      \{1\}, \quad
      \{(1\,2\,3), (1\,4\,2), (1\,3\,4), (2\,4\,3)\}, \quad
      \{(1\,3\,2), (1\,2\,4), (1\,4\,3), (2\,3\,4)\}, \\\text{and}\quad
      \{(1\,2)(3\,4), (1\,3)(2\,4), (1\,4)(2\,3)\}.
    \end{multline*}
    The class equation is $\ord{A_4} = 1 + 3 + 4 + 4$.
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
