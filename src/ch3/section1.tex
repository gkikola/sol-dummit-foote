\section{Definitions and Examples}

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.

\Exercise1 Let $\varphi\colon G\to H$ be a homomorphism and let $E$ be
a subgroup of $H$. Prove that $\varphi^{-1}(E)\leq G$ (i.e., the
preimage or pullback of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a
subgroup). If $E\trianglelefteq H$ prove that
$\varphi^{-1}(E)\trianglelefteq G$. Deduce that
$\ker\varphi\trianglelefteq G$.
\begin{proof}
  Note that $\varphi(1) = 1\in E$ so $\varphi^{-1}(E)$ is
  nonempty. Suppose $a, b \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$, so that
  $\varphi(a) = x$ and $\varphi(b) = y$ for some $x,y\in E$. Then,
  since $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(ab^{-1}) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)^{-1} = xy^{-1} \in E,
  \end{equation*}
  which shows that $ab^{-1}\in\varphi^{-1}(E)$. By the subgroup
  criterion, this shows that $\varphi^{-1}(E)\leq G$.

  Now suppose that $E$ is a normal subgroup of $H$. Let $g\in G$ and
  $n\in\varphi^{-1}(E)$. Then $\varphi(g) = h$ for some $h\in H$ and
  $\varphi(n) = x$ for some $x\in E$. We have
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi(gng^{-1})
    &= \varphi(g)\varphi(n)\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
    &= hxh^{-1}.
  \end{align*}
  But $hxh^{-1}\in E$ since $E\trianglelefteq H$, so
  $gng^{-1}\in\varphi^{-1}(E)$. The choice of $g$ and $n$ were
  arbitrary, so this shows that $\varphi^{-1}(E)\trianglelefteq G$.

  Lastly, if we let $E$ be the trivial subgroup of $H$, then the above
  shows that $\ker\varphi = \varphi^{-1}(E) \trianglelefteq G$ since
  the trivial subgroup is always normal.
\end{proof}
