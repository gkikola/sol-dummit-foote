\section{More on Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem}

Let $G$ be a group.

\Exercise1 Which of the following are permissible orders for subgroups
of a group of order $120$: $1$, $2$, $5$, $7$, $9$, $15$, $60$, $240$?
For each permissible order give the corresponding index.
\begin{solution}
  The permissible orders are $1$, $2$, $5$, $15$, and $60$. The other
  orders do not divide $120$ and so by Lagrange's Theorem are not
  possible.

  The subgroup of order $1$ would have index $120$, the subgroup of
  order $2$ would have index $60$, the subgroup of order $5$ would
  have index $24$, the subgroup with order $15$ would have index $8$,
  and the subgroup of order $60$ would have index $2$.
\end{solution}

\Exercise2 Prove that the lattice of subgroups of $S_3$ in Section~2.5
is correct (i.e., prove that it contains all subgroups of $S_3$ and
that their pairwise joins and intersections are correctly drawn).
\begin{proof}
  The subgroups contained in the lattice are $1$, $\gen{(1\,2)}$,
  $\gen{(1\,3)}$, $\gen{(2\,3)}$, $\gen{(1\,2\,3)}$, and $S_3$
  itself. Since $\ord{S_3} = 6$, any nontrivial subgroups must have
  order $2$ or $3$. Since $\gen{(1\,2\,3)} = \gen{(1\,3\,2)}$, all
  cyclic subgroups are accounted for.

  Now suppose $S_3$ has a non-cyclic proper subgroup $H$. Say $H$ is
  generated by $\sigma$ and $\tau$. Then $\ord{H} = 3$ and
  $H = \{1, \sigma, \tau\}$. But $\ord{\sigma}$ must divide $\ord{H}$,
  so $\ord{\sigma} = 3$. Then $\sigma$ and $\sigma^2$ are distinct,
  and we must have $\tau = \sigma^2$. Hence $H$ is not cyclic, a
  contradiction. This shows that all proper subgroups of $S_3$ are
  cyclic. Therefore all subgroups are present in the lattice.

  Note that the subgroups of order $2$ cannot themselves be subgroups
  of $\gen{(1\,2\,3)}$, since $2\nmid3$. Therefore every nontrivial
  subgroup is maximal, and the lattice is correct.
\end{proof}

\Exercise3 Prove that the lattice of subgroups of $Q_8$ in Section~2.5
is correct.
\begin{proof}
  By Lagrange's Theorem the possible subgroups of $Q_8$ have orders
  $1$, $2$, $4$, and $8$. So every nontrivial subgroup has order $2$
  or $4$. The only element of $Q_8$ having order $2$ is $-1$, so
  $\gen{-1}$ is the only possible subgroup with that order. Every
  other nonidentity element has order $4$. The only subgroups of order
  $4$ are $\gen{i}$, $\gen{j}$, and $\gen{k}$, since all elements of
  $Q_8$ belong to one of these subgroups.

  $\gen{-1}$ is contained in each of $\gen{i}$, $\gen{j}$, and
  $\gen{k}$, and the latter three are maximal by Lagrange. Therefore
  the lattice is correct.
\end{proof}
