\section{Dihedral Groups}

In these exercises, $D_{2n}$ has the usual presentation
\begin{equation*}
  D_{2n} = \langle r,s\mid r^n = s^2 = 1, rs = sr^{-1}\rangle.
\end{equation*}

\Exercise1 Compute the order of each of the elements in the following
groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $D_6$
  \begin{solution}
    The elements of $D_6$ are $1$, $r$, $r^2$, $s$, $sr$, and
    $sr^2$. We have $\abs{1} = 1$, $\abs{r} = 3$, $\abs{r^2} = 3$, and
    $\abs{s} = 2$. Since $(sr)^2 = srsr = s^2r^{-1}r = 1$ and
    $(sr^2)^2 = sr^2sr^2 = s^2r^{-2}r^2 = 1$, we have
    $\abs{sr} = \abs{sr^2} = 2$.
  \end{solution}
\item $D_8$
  \begin{solution}
    Again we have $\abs{1} = 1$, $\abs{r} = 4$, $\abs{r^2} = 2$, and
    $\abs{r^3} = 4$. For $k$ with $0\leq k\leq3$, we have
    $(sr^k)^2 = sr^ksr^k = s^2r^{-k}r^k = 1$ so $\abs{sr^k} = 2$.
  \end{solution}
\item $D_{10}$
  \begin{solution}
    Since $5$ is prime, we have for each $k$ with $0\leq k\leq4$,
    \begin{equation*}
      \abs{r^k} = 5
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \abs{sr^k} = 2. \qedhere
    \end{equation*}
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise2 Use the generators and relations above to show that if $x$
is any element of $D_{2n}$ which is not a power of $r$, then
$rx = xr^{-1}$.
\begin{proof}
  Since any element of $D_{2n}$ that is not a power of $r$ has the
  form $sr^k$ for some integer $k$, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    rx = rsr^k = sr^{-1}r^k = sr^{-k} = sr^kr^{-1} = xr^{-1}. \qedhere
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\Exercise3 Use the generators and relations above to show that every
element of $D_{2n}$ which is not a power of $r$ has order $2$. Deduce
that $D_{2n}$ is generated by the two elements $s$ and $sr$, both of
which have order $2$.
\begin{proof}
  As in the previous exercise, such elements have the form
  $sr^k$. $sr^k$ is distinct from the identity, and
  \begin{equation*}
    (sr^k)^2 = sr^ksr^k = s^2r^{-k}r^k = 1,
  \end{equation*}
  so $\abs{sr^k} = 2$.

  Now, the elements of $D_{2n}$ are $1, r, r^2, \dots, r^n$, and
  $s, sr, \dots, sr^n$. Each $r^k$ can be written as $(s(sr))^k$, and
  each $sr^k$ can be written as $s(s(sr))^k$, so $D_{2n}$ is generated
  by $\{ s, sr \}$, each element of which has order $2$.
\end{proof}
