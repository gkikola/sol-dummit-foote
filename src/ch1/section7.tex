\section{Group Actions}

\Exercise1 Let $F$ be a field. Show that the multiplicative group of
nonzero elements of $F$ (denoted by $F^\times$) acts on the set $F$ by
$g\cdot a = ga$, where $g\in F^\times$, $a\in F$ and $ga$ is the usual
product in $F$ of the two field elements.
\begin{proof}
  Let $g_1,g_2\in F^\times$. Then for any $a\in F$,
  \begin{equation*}
    g_1\cdot(g_2\cdot a) = g_1\cdot g_2a = g_1(g_2a) = (g_1g_2)a
    = (g_1g_2)\cdot a,
  \end{equation*}
  where the second-to-last equality follows from the associativity of
  multiplication in $F$. Also, for any $a\in F^\times$,
  \begin{equation*}
    1\cdot a = 1a = a,
  \end{equation*}
  since $1$ is the identity of the group $F^\times$. And $1(0) = 0$
  (which follows from distributivity), so we can say that
  $1\cdot a = a$ for all $a\in F$. Therefore the mapping
  $(g, a)\mapsto ga$ of $F^\times\times F\to F$ is a group action.
\end{proof}
