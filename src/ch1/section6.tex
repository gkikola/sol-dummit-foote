\section{Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms}

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.

\Exercise1 Let $\varphi\colon G\to H$ be a homomorphism.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n\in\Z^+$.
  \begin{proof}
    We use induction on $n$. The case for $n = 1$ is clear. Suppose
    $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for some particular $n\in\Z^+$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
      \varphi(x^{n+1})
      = \varphi(xx^n)
      = \varphi(x)\varphi(x^n)
      = \varphi(x)\varphi(x)^n
      = \varphi(x)^{n+1},
    \end{equation*}
    so the result holds for all $n\in\Z^+$.
  \end{proof}
\item Do part (a) for $n = -1$ and deduce that
  $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n\in\Z$.
  \begin{solution}
    Let $1_G$ and $1_H$ denote the identities of $G$ and $H$,
    respectively. Then
    \begin{equation*}
      \varphi(1_G)\varphi(1_G) = \varphi(1_G) = \varphi(1_G)1_H,
    \end{equation*}
    and it follows from the cancellation law that
    $\varphi(1_G) = 1_H$. Since the identity is preserved, we will
    simply use $1$ to denote the identity of both groups from this
    point forward.

    Now, for any $x\in G$,
    \begin{equation*}
      \varphi(x)\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(xx^{-1}) = \varphi(1) = 1,
    \end{equation*}
    which shows that $\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$. Then for
    $n\in\Z^+$,
    \begin{equation*}
      \varphi(x^{-n}) = \varphi((x^n)^{-1}) = \varphi(x^n)^{-1}
      = \big(\varphi(x)^n\big)^{-1} = \varphi(x)^{-n}.
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ holds for all $n\in\Z$.
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise2 If $\varphi\colon G\to H$ is an isomorphism, prove that
$\ord{\varphi(x)} = \ord{x}$ for all $x\in G$. Deduce that any two
isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order $n$ for
each $n\in\Z^+$. Is the result true if $\varphi$ is only assumed to be
a homomorphism?
\begin{proof}
  First suppose $\ord{x} = n<\infty$. By the previous exercise, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(x)^n = \varphi(x^n) = \varphi(1) = 1.
  \end{equation*}
  So $\ord{\varphi(x)}\leq n$. On the other hand, if
  $\ord{\varphi(x)} = k$, then
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(x^k) = \varphi(x)^k = 1.
  \end{equation*}
  But $1$ is the only element in $G$ which gets sent to $1$ in $H$,
  since $\varphi$ is a bijection. This shows that $x^k = 1$, so that
  $k\geq n$. Hence $\ord{\varphi(x)} = n$.

  Now suppose $x$ has infinite order. If
  $\ord{\varphi(x)} = n < \infty$, then
  $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n = 1$, and since $\varphi$ is a
  bijection we must have $x^n = 1$, a contradiction. Therefore
  $\varphi(x)$ must also have infinite order.

  From the above we know that $\ord{x} = \ord{\varphi(x)}$ for each
  $x$, and since $\varphi$ is a bijection this shows that $G$ and $H$
  have the same number of elements of each order.

  Finally, this result does not necessarily hold for
  homomorphisms. For example, let $H$ be the trivial group $\{1\}$ and
  take the function $\theta\colon G\to H$ defined by $\theta(x) = 1$
  for all $x\in G$. Then $\theta(x)\theta(y) = \theta(xy)$, so this is
  a homomorphism, but every element in $H$ has order $1$, which is not
  true of $G$ (unless $G$ is also trivial).
\end{proof}

\Exercise3 If $\varphi\colon G\to H$ is an isomorphism, prove that $G$
is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian. If $\varphi\colon G\to H$ is
a homomorphism, what additional conditions on $\varphi$ (if any) are
sufficient to ensure that if $G$ is abelian, then so is $H$?
\begin{solution}
  Since $\varphi$ must be invertible (it is a bijection) and since
  $\varphi^{-1}$ must be an isomorphism from $H$ to $G$, the proof
  only needs to work in one direction. So let $x,y\in H$ be arbitrary,
  and let $a = \varphi^{-1}(x)$ and $b = \varphi^{-1}(y)$. If $G$ is
  abelian, then
  \begin{equation*}
    xy = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = \varphi(ab) = \varphi(ba)
    = \varphi(b)\varphi(a) = yx,
  \end{equation*}
  so $H$ is also abelian, and the proof is complete.

  Note that the same result does not hold for homomorphisms. For
  instance, let $\varphi\colon\Z/2\Z\to D_6$ be given by
  $\varphi(\bar0) = 1$ and $\varphi(\bar1) = s$. Then $\varphi$ is a
  homomorphism and $\Z/2\Z$ is abelian, but $D_6$ is not abelian.

  However, if we add the constraint that $\varphi$ is surjective, then
  the result does hold: Suppose $G$ is abelian, let $x,y\in H$ be
  arbitrary, and pick $a\in\varphi^{-1}(x)$ and $b\in\varphi^{-1}(y)$
  (that is, $a$ and $b$ are chosen from the fibers of $\varphi$ over
  $x$ and $y$). Then, as before,
  \begin{equation*}
    xy = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = \varphi(ab) = \varphi(ba)
    = \varphi(b)\varphi(a) = yx,
  \end{equation*}
  so $H$ is abelian.
\end{solution}
