\section{Subgroups Generated by Subsets of a Group}

\Exercise1 Prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $\gen{H} = H$.
\begin{proof}
  Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Certainly $H\leq\gen{H}$. Now suppose
  $h\in\gen{H}$. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    h\in\bigcap_{\substack{H\subseteq K \\ K\leq G}} K.
  \end{equation*}
  But $H$ itself is a subgroup of $G$ containing itself as a subset,
  so by definition $h\in H$. This shows that $\gen{H}\leq H$ so that
  $\gen{H} = H$ as required.
\end{proof}

\Exercise2 Prove that if $A$ is a subset of $B$ then
$\gen{A}\leq\gen{B}$. Give an example where $A\subseteq B$ with
$A\neq B$ but $\gen{A}=\gen{B}$.
\begin{proof}
  Let $a\in\gen{A}$. Since $A\subseteq B$ we have $a\in B$ so that
  $a\in\gen{B}$. This shows that $\gen{A}\leq\gen{B}$.

  For the requested example, simply consider $Z_4$ with $A = \{x\}$
  and $B = \{x, x^3\}$. Certainly $A\subset B$ but
  $\gen{A} = \gen{B}$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise3 Prove that if $H$ is an abelian subgroup of a group $G$
then $\gen{H, Z(G)}$ is abelian. Give an explicit example of an
abelian subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ such that $\gen{H, C_G(H)}$ is not
abelian.
\begin{proof}
  Let $H\leq G$ be an abelian subgroup and let $g,h\in\gen{H, Z(G)}$
  be arbitrary. By Proposition~9, $g$ and $h$ can be written as a
  finite product
  \begin{equation*}
    g = g_1^{\epsilon_1},\dots,g_m^{\epsilon_m}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    h = h_1^{\delta_1},\dots,h_n^{\delta_n},
  \end{equation*}
  where each $g_i$ and $h_i$ (not necessarily distinct) is in
  $H\cup Z(G)$. Now, members of $H$ commute with each other and with
  members of $Z(G)$, and members of $Z(G)$ commute with each other and
  with members of $H$. Therefore all of the elements in $H\cup Z(G)$
  commute with one another, so we may write
  \begin{equation*}
    gh = g_1^{\epsilon_1},\dots,g_m^{\epsilon_m}
    h_1^{\delta_1},\dots,h_n^{\delta_n}
    = h_1^{\delta_1},\dots,h_n^{\delta_n}
    g_1^{\epsilon_1},\dots,g_m^{\epsilon_m} = hg.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $g,h\in\gen{H, Z(G)}$ were arbitrary, this shows that
  $\gen{H, Z(G)}$ is abelian.

  To show that $\gen{H, C_G(H)}$ is not necessarily abelian, consider
  the dihedral group $D_8$ with $H = \{1, r^2\}$. Since $1$ and $r^2$
  are in $Z(D_8)$, we have $C_G(H) = D_8$. Therefore
  $\gen{H, C_G(H)} = D_8$ is not abelian, even though $H$ is abelian.
\end{proof}

\Exercise4 Prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $H$ is
generated by the set $H - \{1\}$.
\begin{proof}
  If $H = \{1\}$ then $H - \{1\}$ is the empty set which indeed
  generates the trivial subgroup $H$. So suppose $\ord{H} > 1$ and
  pick a nonidentity element $h\in H$. Since
  $1 = hh^{-1}\in\gen{H - \{1\}}$ (Proposition~9), we see that
  $H\leq\gen{H - \{1\}}$. By minimality of $\gen{H - \{1\}}$, the
  reverse inclusion also holds so that $\gen{H - \{1\}} = H$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise5 Prove that the subgroup generated by any two distinct
elements of order $2$ in $S_3$ is all of $S_3$.
\begin{proof}
  There are three elements of order $2$ in $S_3$, namely $(1\,2)$,
  $(1\,3)$, and $(2\,3)$. For $\gen{(1\,2), (1\,3)}$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
    (2\,3) = (1\,3)(1\,2)(1\,3),
    \quad
    (1\,2\,3) = (1\,3)(1\,2),
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    (1\,3\,2) = (1\,2)(1\,3),
  \end{equation*}
  so $\gen{(1\,2), (1\,3)} = S_3$. By symmetry, we also have
  \begin{equation*}
    \gen{(1\,2), (2\,3)} = \gen{(1\,3), (2\,3)} = S_3.
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore the desired result holds.
\end{proof}

\Exercise6 Prove that the subgroup of $S_4$ generated by $(1\,2)$ and
$(1\,2)(3\,4)$ is a noncyclic group of order $4$.
\begin{proof}
  Let $a = (1\,2)$ and $b = (1\,2)(3\,4)$. Note that $a^2 = b^2 = 1$,
  and $ab = ba = (3\,4)$. We see that the set
  $A = \{1, a, b, (3\,4)\}$ is closed under composition and inverses
  and hence is a subgroup of order $4$. Therefore $\gen{a, b} = A$ and
  we see that $A$ is noncyclic since in particular it has two distinct
  elements with order $2$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise7 Prove that the subgroup of $S_4$ generated by $(1\,2)$ and
$(1\,3)(2\,4)$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order $8$.
\begin{proof}
  Let $a = (1\,2)$, $b = (1\,3)(2\,4)$ and $c = (1\,3\,2\,4)$. It is
  easy to check that $ab = c$ so $c\in\gen{a,b}$.

  Clearly $a^2 = c^4 = 1$. Since $b$ is a product of disjoint
  $2$-cycles, it follows that $b^{-1} = b$ so that
  \begin{equation*}
    ca = aba = a(ab)^{-1} = ac^{-1}.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $a$ and $c$ satisfy all the same relations as do $s$ and $r$
  in $D_8$, it follows that there is a homomorphism
  $\varphi\colon D_8\to\gen{a,b}$ defined by
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(s^ir^j) = a^i(ab)^j,
    \quad\text{where $i\in\{0,1\}$ and $j\in\{0,1,2,3\}$}.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $c$, $c^2$, and $c^3$ are all distinct, it follows that
  $\varphi$ is injective. And $\varphi$ is surjective since every
  finite product of powers of $a$ and $b$ can be reduced to the form
  $a^i(ab)^j$ in the same way that elements of $D_8$ can be expressed
  in the form $s^ir^j$. $\varphi$ is bijective, so it is an
  isomorphism and we have $D_8\cong\gen{a,b}$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise8 Prove that $S_4 = \gen{(1\,2\,3\,4), (1\,2\,4\,3)}$.
\label{exercise:S4-generated-by-two-4cycles}
\begin{proof}
  Let $A = \gen{(1\,2\,3\,4),(1\,2\,4\,3)}$. By inspection, we find that
  \begin{equation*}
    (1\,4\,2) = (1\,2\,4\,3)(1\,2\,3\,4).
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore $A$ contains an element of order $3$ as well as elements
  of order $4$. Thus $3$ and $4$ both divide $\ord{A}$. But $\ord{A}$
  also divides $24$, so the only possibilities for $\ord{A}$ are $12$
  and $24$.

  To eliminate $12$ as a possible order, note that
  \begin{equation*}
    (1\,2) = (1\,2\,3\,4)(1\,2\,4\,3)^3(1\,2\,3\,4)
  \end{equation*}
  and
  \begin{equation*}
    (1\,3\,2\,4) = (1\,3)(2\,4)
    = (1\,2\,3\,4)(1\,2\,4\,3)(1\,2\,3\,4)(1\,2\,4\,3)^2.
  \end{equation*}
  So by the previous exercise, we know that $A$ contains a subgroup
  isomorphic to $D_8$. Therefore $8$ divides $\ord{A}$ so we must have
  $A = S_4$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise9 Prove that $SL_2(\F_3)$ is the subgroup of $GL_2(\F_3)$
generated by $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and
$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
\label{exercise:subgroup-SL2-F3}
\begin{proof}
  Let
  \begin{equation*}
    A =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1 \\
      0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    B =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  Note that $A,B\in SL_2(\F_3)$. We are told that we may assume that
  the subgroup $SL_2(\F_3)$ has order $24$, so we can show that
  $\gen{A,B} = SL_2(\F_3)$ if we can show that it has more than $12$
  elements (since the order of $\gen{A,B}$ must divide $24$).

  The matrices $I$, $A$, and $B$, make three elements, so we need to
  find ten more:
  \begin{align*}
    A^2 &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, &
    B^2 &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \\
    AB &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, &
    (AB)^2 &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}, \\
    (AB)^3 &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}, &
    BA &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}, \\
    A^2B^2 &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, &
    ABA &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}, \\
    BAB &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}, &
    A^2B &= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\ord{\gen{A,B}} = 24$ and $\gen{A,B} = SL_2(\F_3)$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{10} Prove that the subgroup of $SL_2(\F_3)$ generated by
$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and
$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ is isomorphic to the
quaternion group of order $8$.
\begin{proof}
  Let
  \begin{equation*}
    A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
    \quad,
    B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix},
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    C = AB = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  Now note that $A^2 = B^2 = C^2 = ABC = -I$ and that $-I$ commutes
  with $A$, $B$, and $C$. Therefore there is a surjective homomorphism
  $\varphi\colon Q_8\to\gen{A,B}$ given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(i) = A \quad\text{and}\quad \varphi(j) = B.
  \end{equation*}
  This shows that $\ord{\gen{A,B}}\leq8$. But $I, -I, A, B, C$ are
  five distinct elements of $\gen{A,B}$, so $\ord{\gen{A,B}} = 8$ and
  $\varphi$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{11} Show that $SL_2(\F_3)$ and $S_4$ are two nonisomorphic
groups of order $24$.
\begin{proof}
  In the previous exercise we saw that $SL_2(\F_3)$ has a subgroup
  isomorphic to $Q_8$. $Q_8$ has six elements of order $4$
  (Exercise~\ref{exercise:Q8-element-order}) while $S_4$ also has six
  elements of order $4$
  (Exercise~\ref{exercise-order-s3-and-s4-elements}). But earlier we
  showed that $S_4$ was generated by two of these elements
  (Exercise~\ref{exercise:S4-generated-by-two-4cycles}). Therefore
  $S_4$ cannot contain a subgroup isomorphic to $Q_8$, and this is
  enough to show that $SL_2(\F_3)$ is not isomorphic to $S_4$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{12} Prove that the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in
$GL_3(\F_2)$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order $8$.
\begin{proof}
  Let $T$ denote the upper triangular matrices of $GL_3(\F_2)$. There
  are $6$ entries in a $3\times3$ matrix that are on or above the
  diagonal. However, none of the diagonal entries can be zero since
  such matrices would have a determinant of zero. Therefore $T$ has
  only $2^3 = 8$ elements.

  Now, let
  \begin{equation*}
    A =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 & 1 \\
      0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    B =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  By direct computation we can see that $A^4 = B^2 = I$ and that
  $AB = BA^{-1}$. Thus the mapping $\varphi\colon D_8\to T$ for which
  $\varphi(r) = A$ and $\varphi(s) = B$ extends to a
  homomorphism. Since $A$ generates a cyclic subgroup of $T$ with
  order $4$ and $B$ is not in this subgroup, it follows that
  $\gen{A,B} = T$ which shows that $\varphi$ is actually
  surjective. Since $\ord{T} = \ord{D_8}$ it must be injective as
  well. Hence $T\cong D_8$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{13} Prove that the multiplicative group of positive rational
numbers is generated by the set
\begin{equation*}
  \left\{\frac1p \;\middle|\; \text{$p$ is a prime}\right\}.
\end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  Call the set $A$ and let $r = s/t$ be a positive rational number,
  where $s$ and $t$ are relatively prime integers. $s$ and $t$ can
  each be factored into a finite (possibly empty) product of powers of
  distinct prime factors. But every prime $p$ is a member of
  $\gen{A}$, since $1/p\in A$ and $\gen{A}$ is closed under
  inverses. Therefore $r$ is a finite product of members of $\gen{A}$,
  so $r\in\gen{A}$ by Proposition~9. This shows that $\gen{A}$ is the
  multiplicative group $\Q^+$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{14} A group $H$ is called {\em finitely generated} if there
is a finite set $A$ such that $H = \gen{A}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that every finite group is finitely generated.
  \begin{proof}
    If $G$ is a finite group, then simply note that $G = \gen{G}$.
  \end{proof}
\item Prove that $\Z$ is finitely generated.
  \begin{proof}
    $\Z$ is finitely generated since it is cyclic: it is generated by
    $\{1\}$.
  \end{proof}
\item Prove that every finitely generated subgroup of the additive
  group $\Q$ is cyclic.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $H$ be a finitely generated subgroup of $\Q$, so that
    $H = \gen{A}$ for some finite set
    \begin{equation*}
      A = \left\{\frac{a_1}{b_1}, \frac{a_2}{b_2},
      \dots, \frac{a_n}{b_n}\right\},
    \end{equation*}
    where each $b_i\neq0$ and $(a_i,b_i) = 1$ for each $i$. Set
    $K = b_1b_2\cdots b_n$. We will show that $H$ is a subgroup of the
    cyclic subgroup generated by $1/K$.

    Now, every element $h$ of $H$ can be written
    \begin{equation*}
      h = c_1\frac{a_{i_1}}{b_{i_1}} + c_2\frac{a_{i_2}}{b_{i_2}}
      + \cdots + c_k\frac{a_{i_k}}{b_{i_k}},
      \quad c_j\in\Z.
    \end{equation*}
    By multiplying the numerator and denominator of each fraction by
    the necessary quantity, we can make each fraction have $K$ in its
    denominator. Then the fractions can be added together to get a
    single fraction of the form
    \begin{equation*}
      h = \frac{J}{K} = J\left(\frac1K\right), \quad J\in\Z.
    \end{equation*}
    This shows that $h\in\gen{1/K}$, so $H$ is a subgroup of a cyclic
    group and is hence cyclic.
  \end{proof}
\item Prove that $\Q$ is not finitely generated.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $\Q$ is finitely generated. Then it must be cyclic by the
    previous part of the exercise. Therefore $\Q = \gen{p/q}$ for some
    relatively prime integers $p$ and $q$ with $q$ nonzero. Let $r$ be
    any prime number that is not a factor of $q$. Since $p/q$ is a
    generator for $\Q$ we must have
    \begin{equation*}
      k\frac{p}{q} = \frac1r
      \quad\text{for some $k\in\Z$}.
    \end{equation*}
    But then $q = pkr$, so that $r$ is a factor of $q$. This
    contradiction shows that $\Q$ cannot be finitely generated.
  \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise{15} Exhibit a proper subgroup of $\Q$ which is not cyclic.
\begin{solution}
  By the previous exercise, we know that such a subgroup cannot be
  finitely generated. Consider the set $A$ given by
  \begin{equation*}
    A = \left\{\frac1{2^k} \;\middle|\; k = 0,1,2,\dots\right\}.
  \end{equation*}
  Let $H = \gen{A}$. Then $H$ is a proper subgroup of $\Q$ since, for
  example, $1/3$ is not a member. If $H$ is cyclic, let it be
  generated by $p/q$ where $p,q\in\Z$. Now $q$ must be a power of $2$,
  say $q = 2^n$. Then $1/2^{n+1}$ is not an integer multiple of $p/q$,
  but it is in $H$. This shows that $H$ is not cyclic.
\end{solution}

\Exercise{16} A subgroup $M$ of a group $G$ is called a {\em maximal
  subgroup} if $M\neq G$ and the only subgroups of $G$ which contain
$M$ are $M$ and $G$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that if $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite group $G$
  then there is a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$.
  \begin{proof}
    If $H$ is maximal, then we are done. If $H$ is not maximal, then
    there is a subgroup $K_1$ of $G$ such that $H<K_1<G$. If $K_1$ is
    maximal, we are done. But if $K_1$ is not maximal, there is a
    subgroup $K_2$ with $H<K_1<K_2<G$. If $K_2$ is maximal, we are
    done, and if not, keep repeating the procedure. Since $G$ is
    finite, this process must eventually come to an end, so that $K_n$
    is maximal for some positive integer $n$. Then $K_n$ is a maximal
    subgroup containing $H$.
  \end{proof}
\item Show that the subgroup of all rotations in a dihedral group is a
  maximal subgroup.
  \begin{proof}
    Fix a positive integer $n>1$ and let $H\leq D_{2n}$ consist of the
    rotations of $D_{2n}$. That is, $H = \gen{r}$. Now, this subgroup
    is proper since it does not contain $s$. If $H$ is not maximal,
    then by the previous proof we know there is a maximal subset $K$
    containing $H$. Then $K$ must contain a reflection $sr^k$ for
    $k\in\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$. Then since $sr^k\in K$ and
    $r^{n-k}\in K$, it follows by closure that
    \begin{equation*}
      s = (sr^k)(r^{n-k})\in K.
    \end{equation*}
    But $D_{2n} = \gen{r,s}$, so this shows that $K = D_{2n}$, which
    is a contradiction. Therefore $H$ must be maximal.
  \end{proof}
\item Show that if $G = \gen{x}$ is a cyclic group of order $n\geq1$
  then a subgroup $H$ is maximal if and only if $H = \gen{x^p}$ for
  some prime $p$ dividing $n$.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$. Then $H$ is cyclic, and
    we may write $H = \gen{x^k}$ for some integer $k$, with $k >
    1$. Let $d = (n,k)$. Since $H$ is a proper subgroup, we know by
    Proposition~6 that $d > 1$. Choose a prime factor $p$ of $d$. If
    $k = p = d$ then $k\mid n$ as required.

    If, however, $k$ is not prime, then consider the subgroup
    $K = \gen{x^p}$. Since $p$ is a proper divisor of $k$, it follows
    that $H<K$. But $H$ is maximal, so we must have $K = G$. Again by
    Proposition~6, we must then have $(p,n) = 1$. However, $p$ divides
    $d$ which divides $n$, so $p\mid n$ and $(p,n) = p > 1$, a
    contradiction. Therefore $k = p$ and the left-to-right implication
    holds.

    Now, for the converse, suppose $H = \gen{x^p}$ for $p$ a prime
    dividing $n$. If $H$ is not maximal then the first part of this
    exercise shows that there is a maximal subgroup $K$ containing
    $H$. Then $K = \gen{x^q}$. So $x^p\in\gen{x^q}$, which implies
    $q\mid p$. But the only divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$. If
    $q = 1$ then $K = G$ and $K$ cannot be a proper subgroup, and if
    $q = p$ then $H = K$ and $H$ cannot be a proper subgroup of
    $K$. This contradiction shows that $H$ is maximal.
  \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise{19} A nontrivial abelian group $A$ (written
multiplicatively) is called {\em divisible} if for each element
$a\in A$ and each nonzero integer $k$ there is an element $x\in A$
such that $x^k = a$, i.e., each element has a $k$\textsuperscript{th}
root in $A$ (in additive notation, each element is the
$k$\textsuperscript{th} multiple of some element of $A$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that the additive group of rational numbers, $\Q$, is
  divisible.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $r\in\Q$ and $k\in\Z$ be arbitrary, with $k$ nonzero. Then
    $x = r/k$ is such that $kx = r$. Hence $\Q$ is divisible.
  \end{proof}
\item Prove that no finite abelian group is divisible.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be any nontrivial finite abelian group, and suppose
    $\ord{G} = n$. Since $G$ is nontrivial, we may choose a
    nonidentity element $x\in G$. Then there is no element $y\in G$
    such that $y^n = x$, for the simple reason that we must have
    $y^n = 1$ (since $\ord{y}$ has to divide $n$). Therefore $G$ is
    not divisible.
  \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise{20} Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are nontrivial abelian groups,
then $A\times B$ is divisible if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are
divisible groups.
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $A\times B$ is divisible. Let $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ be
  arbitrary, and let $k$ be any nonzero integer. Then there is
  $(c,d)\in A\times B$ such that $(c,d)^k = (a,b)$. But
  $(c,d)^k = (c^k,d^k)$, so $c^k = a$ and $d^k = b$, which shows that
  $A$ and $B$ are both divisible.

  Conversely, let $A$ and $B$ be divisible, let $(a,b)\in A\times B$
  be arbitrary, and let $k$ be any nonzero integer. Since $A$ is
  divisible, there is $c\in A$ with $c^k = a$, and since $B$ is
  divisible there is $d\in B$ with $d^k = b$. Then $(c,d)^k = (a,b)$,
  which shows that $A\times B$ is divisible.
\end{proof}
